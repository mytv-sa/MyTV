"""optimize/run.sh: one run at a time, and a last line that says how it ended. A stub tv.py and stub steps, no TV needed.

    python3 tests/run_lock_test.py

Each case copies run.sh into a scratch tree whose steps are stubs (a step named in FAIL_AT fails, one named in SLOW_AT
waits for a file), then checks what run.sh printed last and how the lock file behaved.
